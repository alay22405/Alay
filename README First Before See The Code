We are currently working: As a user I want to export and import other information in the application.

The SAMA’s project design aims are to capture functionality and simplicity of the client's desired application 
while creating a User Friendly UI.  The client’s desire is to implement a program that can store user settings 
that can be applied to other devices.  Additionally, they want to be able to store other types of information to the application.
For that reason, we created a design capable of storing user settings such as First Name and Email and text files that contain other
types of information they would like to store into the application along a user will be able to export and import settings for synchronization
to other devices. So, Program/Code to review is a java file found under the directory labeled "Code", and the program is named GUIHandler.java along with other classes like GUI
So, as a reviewer, you are welcome to give us a feedback how and what to improve for what we have worked so far.
